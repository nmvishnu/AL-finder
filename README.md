# AL-finder
Windows batch file to display hostname and AlertLogic processes and services. Creates an AL_out.txt file in executed directory.

IMPORTANT: Requires WRITE permission within the folder from which batch file is executed.

Works for Standard users and Administrators. Should work for most of the Windows versions with Standard user priveilages.

P.S. I'm not a 'Pro' in batch scripting. Created as a quick, lazy work - DO NOT expect Updates, Fixes, etc.

Feel free to modify this code and use it in your work/project.
